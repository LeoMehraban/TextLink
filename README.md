This is the TextLink 0.6 Code as it was when I stopped development on it 

Some features may be inconstitant with 0.1, as, around a year after I stopped development, I made some minor bugfix changes. These bugs may still be in this version. It's been a while since I checked

0.6 added the .input command, and variables, as well as color

Have a nice day!
